## 📋 About

This repository contains the source code for Vue DnD Kit - a lightweight, high-performance drag and drop toolkit for Vue 3 applications. Inspired by the popular [React DnD Kit](https://dndkit.com/), but specifically designed for the Vue.js ecosystem.

## 🚀 Features

- **Composable API**: Simple composables like `useDraggable` and `useDroppable` for creating drag and drop interfaces
- **High Performance**: Built with performance in mind using efficient algorithms and optimizations
- **TypeScript Support**: Written in TypeScript for better developer experience and code reliability
- **Accessibility**: Designed with accessibility in mind, supporting keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **Flexible**: Create custom drag overlays, handles, and complex nested interfaces

## 📦 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several packages:

- **packages/core**: The main package with core drag and drop functionality
- **packages/components**: (Coming soon) Ready-to-use components built on top of the core library
- **packages/utils**: (Coming soon) Utility functions for advanced customization
