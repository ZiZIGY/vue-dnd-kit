# About Vue DnD Kit

## Project Origin

Vue DnD Kit was born out of necessity when I needed to build a WYSIWYG editor with advanced drag and drop functionality. After searching for existing solutions, I couldn't find any library that met all my requirements:

- Support for keyboard-based drag and drop for accessibility
- Multi-drag capability to move multiple items simultaneously
- Dynamic layer/z-index changes when hovering over drop zones
- Custom animations during drag operations
- Lightweight yet powerful API out of the box

Facing these challenges, I decided to create my own comprehensive solution from scratch. This project is the evolution of my previous work with Vue DnD Hooks, completely reimagined for Vue 3's Composition API with a focus on modularity and extensibility.

## Vision

My vision for Vue DnD Kit is to create the most developer-friendly drag and drop ecosystem for Vue applications. I believe that:

1. **Developers shouldn't have to compromise** between ease of use and flexibility
2. **Performance should be a priority**, not an afterthought
3. **Accessibility should be built-in**, not added later
4. **Documentation matters** as much as the code itself

## Roadmap

Here's what I'm planning for future releases:

### Short-term

- Expand component library with more specialized components
- Add more examples and recipes for common patterns
- Improve testing coverage and performance benchmarks
- Create comprehensive documentation with interactive examples

### Mid-term

- Add specialized modules for specific use cases (form builders, page builders)
- Create ecosystem plugins for popular UI frameworks
- Implement advanced animation capabilities
- Add support for extremely large datasets

### Long-term

- Explore Vue DnD Kit Plus with premium features for enterprise users
- Create a visual builder for drag and drop interfaces
- Expand the ecosystem based on community feedback
