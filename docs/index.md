::: tip Keyboard & Mouse Navigation
Try interacting with the demo above:

**Mouse:**

- Click and drag elements with your mouse
- Drop them in the target zone

**Keyboard:**

- Use **Tab** to focus on the draggable element
- Press **Space** to start dragging
- Use **<kbd>WASD</kbd>** to move the element
- Press **Enter** to drop in the target zone
- Press **Escape** to cancel dragging

You can seamlessly switch between mouse and keyboard at any time during the drag operation!

## Sortable Lists Made Easy

Vue DnD Kit makes it simple to create sortable interfaces. Try reordering the items below:

<DnDList />

## Seamless Animation Support

Vue DnD Kit is designed to work perfectly with Vue's built-in transition system and third-party animation libraries:

- **Vue Transitions**: Full support for `<Transition>` and `<TransitionGroup>` components
- **GSAP Integration**: Works seamlessly with GreenSock Animation Platform
- **Motion One**: Compatible with Motion One for physics-based animations
- **CSS Animations**: Easily apply CSS animations during drag operations
- **Custom Animation Hooks**: Add your own animation logic at any point in the drag lifecycle

## Ecosystem Integration

Vue DnD Kit is designed to play nicely with the Vue ecosystem and other popular libraries:

- **Pinia/Vuex**: Easily integrate with state management solutions
- **UI Libraries**: Compatible with Vuetify, PrimeVue, Element Plus, and more
- **Headless UI**: Perfect companion for headless UI libraries like VueUse
- **Tailwind CSS**: Easily style your drag and drop interfaces with utility classes

## Accessibility First

Vue DnD Kit is built with accessibility in mind. All draggable elements work seamlessly with keyboard navigation, making your interfaces accessible to everyone:

- **Tab** navigation between draggable elements
- **Space** to start dragging
- **Arrow keys** to move elements
- **Enter** to drop in target zones
- **Escape** to cancel dragging operations

You can seamlessly switch between mouse and keyboard interactions at any point during the drag operation, providing flexibility for all users regardless of their preferred input method.

This ensures your drag and drop interfaces are usable by people who rely on assistive technologies or prefer keyboard navigation.
